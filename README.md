# DrakesQuestV1.0
Hello! This project will serve as a testing ground for my future video game called "Drake's Quest". I will be programming in Java using the JavaFX
library to create a 2D role playing game similar to Final Fantasy for the Nintendo Entertainment system. As the summer of 2018 moves on, I will
continue to add to this project and update as much as I can. My first plan is to get a simple turn based battle system. My purpose for the battle
system is to create a scene where a character can attack an enemy and interact with it with various weapons and magic.
