# Drakes Quest v1.0
Hello! This project will serve as a testing ground for my future video game called "Drake's Quest". I will be programming in Java using the JavaFX
library to create a 2D role playing game similar to Final Fantasy for the Nintendo Entertainment system. As the summer of 2018 moves on, I will
continue to add to this project and update as much as I can. My first plan is to get a simple turn based battle system. My purpose for the battle
system is to create a scene where a character can attack an enemy and interact with it with various weapons and magic.

## Getting Started

Easy now! I know you're excited, but this project is too early to test. Feel free to browse the code for now. My goal
is to update this project everyday as I work through the basics of learning JavaFX.

### What to expect:
* JavaFX window displaying a title and an empty scene.
* Eventually data will be present on the screen such as Health, Magic Points,
status effects, levels, experience etc.
* At some point, an enemy may show up on the screen.
* Extremely basic but functional battle system.
* 100% pure awesomeness.
